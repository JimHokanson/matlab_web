#Matlab Web Functions#

This is my personal repository for web based things in Matlab. It is currently under construction as I port things from some old code that is less organized.

## Some Initial Work ##

**JSOUP**

JSOUP is a handy html tool. I have switched to using it in all of my web based parsing code.

**FORM PROCESSING**

See: html.form

This the main part of the html work. I am working on refactoring some old code so it is easier to handle form manipulations. This class work can be used in other projects, such as one I have started with Google Scholar (not in this repository)

##Status##

My current work is focused on finishing the html.forms. Currently I have finished the parsing and I'm working on methods for manipulating fields. Once finished, I'll throw together code that submits the form.
